Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning
Hado van Hasselt, Arthur Guez, David Silver

Carefully read the paper (pages 1-7). We will discuss the questions below. 
Note: the online network is also called the policy network in literature.

Questions for Discussion:

1) What is the main problem that this paper addresses?

2) How does the algorithm solve this problem? Hint: How do the neural network weights play a role?

3) Look at the update equation for the target. How does it differ from DQN?
