## INTRODUCTION TO THE MODULE

In this first module, you will learn the definition of the reinforcement learning problem. 
You will encounter the important elements of the setup, such as value functions, state space, and action space.


## LEARNING OUTCOMES

At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to:

- Explain how reinforcement learning is different from other machine learning problems
- Explain the key elements of RL
- Distinguish between reward and value
- Distinguish between exploration and exploitation, explaining the tradeoff in value discovery
- Explain the difference between behavior policy and target policy
- Define the elements such as state space and action space for a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe
