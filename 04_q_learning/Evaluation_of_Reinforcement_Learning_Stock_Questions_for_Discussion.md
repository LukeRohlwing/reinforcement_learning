1) From GitHub, run this [file:](https://github.com/jonah-b-ezekiel/CS221/blob/main/V2.py)  
This should produce performance graphs.

2) This fails. Why?

```
q_learning.q[state]
```

3) Do you notice a difference on training vs test set performance?

4) Do you think that training on more episodes might improve performance on the test set?
Increase the number of training episodes and evaluate. Explain what you find.
