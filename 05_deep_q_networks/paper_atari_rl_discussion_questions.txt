Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning
Mnih et. al.

Carefully read the paper. We will discuss the questions below. 

---

Questions for Discussion:

1) What was novel about this paper?

2) Why do you think the authors picked Atari games as the subject matter?

3) In RL, there are typically sequences of highly correlated states.  
Why does this pose a problem? How is this handled in the approach?

4) What is a Q-network?

5) The target y is a function of immediate reward and the future expected value. How is it different from supervised learning?

6) How is stochastic gradient descent used?
