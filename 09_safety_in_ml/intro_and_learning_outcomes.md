## INTRODUCTION TO THE MODULE

Reinforcement learning algorithms propose recommendations over time, and it is important that these recommendations are safe. In this module, we read and discuss two papers on this topic. "Preventing undesirable behavior of intelligent machines" provides a general framework for algorithm design that shifts the burden of safety from the user to the designer of the algorithm. "Using Reinforcement Learning to Identify High Risk States and Treatments in Healthcare" recognizes that RL cannot find the optimal policy for the medical application at hand. Rather, the paper provides a method for identifying and avoiding medical dead ends, which are states which invariably lead to bad outcomes.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to:

- Explain why safety needs to be directly incorporated into ML models
- Explain medical dead ends
- Explain how Seldonian algorithms work
- Discuss methods for making RL models safer
