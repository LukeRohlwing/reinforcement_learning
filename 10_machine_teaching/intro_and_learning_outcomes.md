## INTRODUCTION TO THE MODULE

Reinforcement learning requires a large amount of data since the agent may be only exposed to training examples...and not guidance. Machine Teaching (MT) focuses on extracting knowledge from a teacher, or subject-matter expert on a topic. This can be more a more efficient learning strategy (fewer samples / less training / less compute needed). We will touch on several approaches to machine teaching in this module.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to:

- Explain the benefit of Machine Teaching (MT)
- Describe different methods for MT
- Apply Reward Shaping to teach an agent to reach a goal
- Describe a method for preventing impossible / unwanted actions from a given state
- Explain the idea of Curriculum Learning
